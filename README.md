## Code  

The code is available in the zip file Code_and_plots.zip, and is named plotting.py.  
Its a python can script and can be run by the following command:  

python plotting.py

## Dataset  

We will be dealing with the dataset from this [link](https://data.gov.in/catalog/gdp-india-and-major-sectors-economy-share-each-sector-gdp-and-growth-rate-gdp-and-other?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=88141&format=json&offset=0&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc).  
It has the details about the GDP of major sectors of the Indian Economy during the timeline 1951 to 2013.  

## Scatter Plot  

We will be plotting the percentage growth rate of the GDP against time.  
Also we would be plotting the growth rate of sectors - Mining and Quarrying, and the Services sector against it, such that we can see the correlation between the performance of the services and the growth in the country's GDP.  

You can see the plot below:
