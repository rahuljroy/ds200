## Dataset  

We will be dealing with the dataset from this [link](https://data.gov.in/catalog/gdp-india-and-major-sectors-economy-share-each-sector-gdp-and-growth-rate-gdp-and-other?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=88141&format=json&offset=0&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc).  
It has the details about the GDP of major sectors of the Indian Economy during the timeline 1951 to 2013.  

## Scatter Plot  

We will be plotting the percentage growth rate of the GDP against time.  
Also we would be plotting the growth rate of sectors - Mining and Quarrying, and the Services sector against it, such that we can see the correlation between the performance of the services and the growth in the country's GDP.  

## Box Plot  

We will be plotting the box and whiskers plot of Agriculture, Industry, Mining, Manufacturing and the Services growth over the years.  

## Line Plot  


We would be plotting line plots of Agriculture, Industry and the Manufacting sectors.
